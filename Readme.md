# Gallery albums for Contao Open Source CMS

This Bundle provides gallery albums with categories.


## Installation

Install the bundle via Composer:

```
composer require bwein-net/contao-gallery
```

## Migrate from photoalbums

Since the extension [craffft/contao-photoalbums2](https://packagist.org/packages/craffft/contao-photoalbums2) is not maintained and does not support Contao 5, you can migrate - see: [bwein-net/contao-migrate-pa2-gallery](https://packagist.org/packages/bwein-net/contao-migrate-pa2-gallery)
